These tags are meant to be replacements due to the complexity of referencing them - for example, each chud_definition would have to be referenced by a weapon, equipment, ect, so then there would need to be a custom tag for that as well, then after that a custom tag for everything in the game that references those weapons and equipment which is a lot. So these tags are replacements, even though it's ugly.
